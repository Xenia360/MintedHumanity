## Introduction

**TSE-EQX NFT Exchange** is a revolutionary human-centered blockchain framework that integrates:

- **TSE (Total Share Economy):** A new post-capitalist framework that redefines value as shared dignity and presence.
- **EQX (Emotional Quotient Exchange):** A scoring and token system that measures and rewards emotional intelligence and ethical contribution.
- **NFT Infrastructure:** A smart contract-based recognition system for emotional labor, culture, peacebuilding, and creative expressions.

This project is designed to **unlock the $70 trillion in hidden human value** currently ignored by traditional GDP-based models — using cutting-edge blockchain, AI, and socio-cultural frameworks.

## Vision

A global platform where **empathy is rewarded**, **wisdom is tokenized**, and **every act of love, creativity, or peace becomes a tradeable asset**.
